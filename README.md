## Overview

![Alt Text](./Images/teaser_figure.png)

In this paper, we first devise a standard association benchmark based on adjective and verb association semantic concepts. Instead of costly data annotation and organization, we propose a convenient annotation-free reconstruction method transforming the general dataset for our association tasks. Furthermore, we comprehensively investigate the MLLMsâ€™ ability and potential for associative ability.

## Dataset

We reconstructed two association datasets based on adjective and verb concepts, for details on how to download the dataset and the structure please refer to [Data](./data/Data.md).

## Installation
For Python environment, see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Evaluation
